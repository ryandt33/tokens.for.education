# Tokens.For.Education

A simple webapp to help you explore tokens.

This goes with the [Tokens.For.Education.Backend](https://github.com/ryandt33/tokens.for.education.backend) which stores your API key so you can share the link internally. It simply forwards the request and passes it with the API key.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Go to the folder

3. npm i

4. Update the .env file with your backend URL

5. npm run dev/build (if you want to build or run a developer version)

6. You might need to setup an NGINX reverse proxy or other service to get this accessible on the internet
